# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This application allows users to search weather conditions of a city. Users are able to select the temperature units when making their search. In addition, past searches are logged in a search history, so users can revisit weather conditions of cities searched before.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To search, click on the input and input a city. If the search entry is not a city, then an invalid message will pop up. Otherwise, users will see the current weather conditions and the five-day forecast of their search. Furthermore, users can click on the buttons in the Past Searches box to see the weather forecast of that city in the specified units.
